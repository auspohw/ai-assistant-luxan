# LUXAN – Personal AI Study & Motivation Assistant

**LUXAN** is a custom AI assistant designed to help users stay focused, motivated, and productive throughout the day. Built using prompt engineering techniques, it simulates a friendly and empathetic coach that checks in with the user, offers encouragement, and suggests useful productivity techniques.

## 🧠 Purpose
This project explores how large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can be shaped through prompting to simulate helpful assistant personalities tailored to specific goals—in this case, daily productivity and mental focus.

## 🔍 How It Works
LUXAN asks:
1. What you want to accomplish today
2. How you feel
3. What challenges you foresee

Then it responds with:
- Kind encouragement
- One useful technique (Pomodoro, mindfulness, etc.)
- A question to help you stay engaged and consistent

## 💬 Example Use Cases
- Daily morning check-ins
- Motivation for studying or working from home
- Gentle nudges to avoid procrastination

## 📄 Files
- `prompt.txt`: The main prompt used to create the assistant behavior
- `example.md`: Example interactions with LUXAN

## 🌍 Language
English  
Location: Italy (remote work-friendly)

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add memory features (via API tools)
- Deploy in a web or mobile app
- Translate assistant to multiple languages
